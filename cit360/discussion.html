    <h2>Discussion Board Conversation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Here is an conversation that was had between other classmates
            and myself. I learned and got a lot help from the class and I hope that 
            I was able to help someone as well. This was my favorite discussion where 
            I feel like I was able to help.

                I tell you I miss the old discussion boards on Brightspace or whatever 
                it was called before they switched to Canvas.  Canvas is great in many,
                many ways.  I think it's number one in Education software right now.  
                But the discussion boards are harder to read and search and less 
                comprehensible.  My only complaint.  I know of no better way than to 
                go to 8 weeks of discussion boards and search through each one...</p>

                I agree, it is a challenge to go back and search through all the 
                discussions. What I started doing was bookmarking any links on a 
                topic that someone shares. That way when I get to that topic I 
                can look at my bookmarks. That is the only way I have been able 
                to use the discussions boards easier. It might work for you as 
                well!

                Thanks I will give that a try.  I started making a list, 
                but even then there were some great posts without links or 
                extra resources that had useful information that I just 
                have to go through a re-read everything!

                Awesome, Tyson! I didn't even think about bookmarks! GENIUS! 
                I will have to start employing that, myself. I know there have 
                been a lot of great topics discussed and things we have to 
                figure out.

                Something that I've done on my computer is use Chrome and have 
                a lot of tabs open for various things. When I open a link, I can 
                return to it without having to click on the link again. This 
                allows me to have 4 or 5 tabs with discussion boards so I can 
                look at several and pick what I want without digging through all 
                the boards in a single tab. Something else I do is separate the 
                tabs of my classes by left and right side of the window. I keep 
                all my personal other stuff on my computer separate by using a 
                different browser. That way I can have a lot of tabs open without 
                too much chaos. I like structure and orderly things so I try to 
                keep it as much on my computer as I can because that is where I 
                can keep the most control over it. Hopefully this helps some.

                That's a great idea, Tyson. I wish I had started that back in 
                Week 1! I am also just opening all 8 weeks and searching the 
                page for whatever topic that I'm working on. Even if it's not 
                as convenient as having one dedicated place to search for 
                these things, it is still a great resource to have as I'm 
                working on a particular topic.
