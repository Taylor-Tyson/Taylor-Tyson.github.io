        <h3>Introduction to my experience in CIT360:</h3>
        <p>
            This has been an intersing class to say the least. There were times when I 
            wanted to give up and quit, and other times where I really enjoyed it 
            and wanted to do more. This class was frustrating with not understanding
            what was expected but after about week three or four it started to make 
            more sense. Defnitely a cahllenging class. 
        </p>

            One thing with this class is that it required a lot of communication 
            with the other class members. There was a lot of help that came from 
            the discussion boards to ask questions and to find answers to questions that 
            others asked. I don't feel that I was able to help people much throughout 
            the semester but I did try. I think I received more help than anything. 
            One thing that I think can be learned from the discussion boards is that
            talking to and working with classmates or co-workers, is a great way to 
            learn and teach each other. I think in the IT industry that working as a 
            team is vital to success. I experienced this in this class and I like to 
            think that I helped others, even if it was something simple. I want to share 
            an example of where I might have been able to help others. Please click

            I often think to myself that if I was to take this class again what would I 
            do different. I think one of things I would do, and I bet just about everyone
            in the class would say this, but I would have managed my time better. This 
            class is different than other classes in that you don't have to turn assignments 
            in weeekly. You acutally make your own schedule and have to stick to it. 
            I do this at work everyday and am do really well at sticking to it, but for 
            some reason this class was hard to stick to the schedule on.

        <h3>Learning and Teaching:</h3>
        <p>
            As I mentioned above, the discussion boards were a great place for resources
            and to work with the class. Antother thing about this class that we did was 
            work with a group. Sometimes this can be hard to do remotely, but at my work
            we have meetings everyday where someone is remote, including myself. I think 
            that this is becoming more and more common in the work place. This class can 
            prepare you for remote working. When you work remote, which for me is working 
            from home, you have to be self motivated and focused on your work. It could be
            easy to get distracted at home with kids or things that you want to get done
            around the house, but you have to be disciplined. Just like in this class. You
            have to be responsible for your own learning and getting your work done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this class, and in the work place, your team can make or break you. I 
            learned again that having a good team is vital to succeeding. The opposite
            is true as well, if you don't have a good team you are more prone to 
            fail. Being part of a team means that you are there to help one another and, 
            as done in this class, you teach one another. When you teach someone, it also 
            helps you to learn and understand the topic better. I found this to be the case 
            when I was able to teach Java Collections and other topcis. I would like to share
            a video of me teaching Java Collections to my group. I hope that you enjoy!
