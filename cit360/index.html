        <h3>Introduction to my experience in CIT360:</h3>
        <p>
            This has been an interesting class to say the least. There were times when 
            I wanted to give up and quit, and other times where I really enjoyed it and 
            wanted to do more. This class was frustrating with not understanding what 
            was expected but after about week three or four it started to make more sense. 
            This is definitely a challenging class.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing with this class is that it required a lot of communication with 
            the other class members. There was a lot of help that came from the discussion 
            boards to ask questions and to find answers to questions that others asked. 
            I don't feel that I was able to help people much throughout the semester, 
            but I did try. I think I received more help than anything. One thing that 
            I think can be learned from the discussion boards is that talking to and 
            working with classmates or co-workers, is a great way to learn and teach 
            each other. I think in the IT industry that working as a team is vital to 
            success. I experienced this in this class, and I like to think that I helped 
            others, even if it was something simple. I want to share an example of where 
            I might have been able to help others. Please click 
            <a href="/cit360/discussion.html">here</a> to read it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I often think to myself that if I was to take this class again what would I 
            do different. I think one of things I would do, and I bet just about everyone 
            in the class would say this, but I would have managed my time better. This 
            class is different than other classes in that you don't have to turn assignments 
            in weekly. You make your own schedule and must stick to it. I do this at work 
            every day and do well at sticking to it, but for some reason this class was 
            hard to stick to the schedule.

        <h3>Learning and Teaching:</h3>
        <p>
            As I mentioned above, the discussion boards were a great place for resources 
            and to work with the class. Another thing about this class that we did was 
            work with a group. Sometimes this can be hard to do remotely, but at my work 
            we have meetings everyday where someone is remote, including myself. I think 
            that this is becoming more and more common in the workplace. This class can 
            prepare you for remote working. When you work remote, which for me is working 
            from home, you have to be self-motivated and focused on your work. It could 
            be easy to get distracted at home with kids or things that you want to get 
            done around the house, but you must be disciplined. Just like in this class. 
            You must be responsible for your own learning and getting your work done.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this class, and in the workplace, your team can make or break you. I learned 
            again that having a good team is vital to succeeding. The opposite is true as 
            well, if you don't have a good team you are more prone to fail. Being part of 
            a team means that you are there to help one another and, as done in this class, 
            you teach one another. When you teach someone, it also helps you to learn and 
            understand the topic better. I found this to be the case when I was able to 
            teach Java Collections and other topics. I would like to share a video of me 
            teaching Java Collections to my group. I hope that you enjoy!

        <h3>Java Topics:</h3>
        <p>
            I have taken a few Java classes now, and this one had been the most interesting in a 
            lot of ways. Some classes have been more in depth on different topics but this one  
            went over fourteen topics that if you had the time, you could spend multiple 
            semesters to really cover them all. I was a bit overwhelmed with all that was required
            for this class and even though I didn't do a final project, I can 
            see the value is making this class so intense. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to humble myself a little bit and get past the frustration. It wasn't until 
            I changed my attitude and sat down and did the work that I was actually able 
            to think through it and get it done. That is one thing that I learned about 
            myself in this class. Your attitude can also make or break you. This goes for 
            anything in life. If you have a bad attitude, then you are going to be miserable.
            If you have a positive attitude, even in what seems to be a negative situation, 
            then you are going to find joy and do a better job. 
        </p>

        <h3>CIT360 Summary:</h3>
        <p>
            In the end, I think that this class in its own way was good for me to take. It 
            helped me to see a new way to think when it comes to a college course and with 
            how I manage my time. It also opened my eyes to new topics in Java. It was 
            interesting to see how to use threads and runnables in a Java program. 
            Understanding this more really opens things up on managing how your program will 
            run on a computer. On a simpler topic, I found it beneficial to learn more about 
            JSON. I have been exposed to JSON at work and other places, not knowing that it 
            was JSON.
        </p>

            I am grateful for the opportunity to be in this course and to work with the 
            great students that I was able to work with. I am also grateful to Brother 
            Lawrence for all that he did to help us through the semester.
