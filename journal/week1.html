    <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            This week there wasn't any development that went on. I spent the week working 
            on getting familiar with the course and what would be expected. I can see 
            that I am going to need to have an open mind through this semester to be able 
            to get what I need out of it and to be able to pass. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am looking forward for the weeks ahead! 
        </p>
