    <h2>Week 10</h2>
    <p>This week was an interesting week because I had a lot of other stuff
        to do in my other class and I was pretty much caught up in this one. 
        I did do a few fixes on my code that I needed to do and I did finish 
        the HTML canvas tag that I had started a few weeks ago but had issues 
        with. I also finished some of my other topics that I needed to turn 
        in. I found out this week that I was better able to focus on my work
        when I have quiet and no distractions. I used to not be this way. 
        I used to need music or something playing to keep my focused but now
        I am not that way. It is interesting for me to think about.
