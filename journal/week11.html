    <h2>Week 11</h2>
    <p>
        This week was a fun week! It was a week I was hoping to 
        start working on my program. I was way wrong! Not only was 
        Thanksgiving this week but on Wednesday morning at 3:00 AM 
        I woke up and was extremely sick. I was not able to go to 
        work, not able to work on school, and almost had to cancel 
        family coming to our home for Thanksgiving. Gratefully, I 
        was able to start feeling a little better where I could eat 
        some of the Thanksgiving dinner, but I was not doing well 
        for most of the week. Here is to hoping for a better week 
        next week.
