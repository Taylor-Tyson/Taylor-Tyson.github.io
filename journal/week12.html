    <h2>Week 12</h2>
    <p>
        This week I was able to get a great start on my final program. I
        wasn't one hundred percent sure what I was going to do for it but 
        as I started to put it together it fell into place. I should have 
        taken more time before to plan it out  better and to determine how 
        I was going to work the topics in. I think that it would have helped 
        me to put it together in a cleaner way and even would have helped 
        me to program it faster. I didn't get it completely finished this 
        week so I will need to work on it next week but I fell that I got 
        a really good start on it.
