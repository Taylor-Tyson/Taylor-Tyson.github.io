    <h2>Week 13</h2>
    <p>
        This week I was able to get my program finished. There is one of the 
        CSS topics that I didn't work in because I couldn't think of a way that 
        made sense to add it. I hope that this doesn't hurt my grade too bad. I 
        am using an API where I can get the sales tax rate by entering a zip 
        code. Calling the API and getting a result was simple but I had a 
        struggle to get the data I needed from the JSON that was returned. 
        It took me a bit to figure out that to access the data I needed, that 
        it was in an array. I don't know how best to explain it, but this is what 
        I had to do: response.TaxInfoItems[0].TaxRate. The response was my parsed 
        JSON, and within that I had to access the TaxRate in the TaxInfoItems[0]. 
        At first I was trying to access it like: response.TaxInfoItems.0.TaxRate, 
        but using the 0 would not work. I tried a few different ways unsuccessfully.
        As I looked at the returned JSON more closely I was able to see that it 
        looked like the TaxRate and other data was in an array. So I tried to access 
        it as if it was in an array and it worked. It was a good moment when I got 
        it to work.
