    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>This week was a lot of trying to figure out what this class 
        is all about and how it works. I worked with my team to come 
        up with a plan for the semester and they seem to be a good 
        group of people. I am not sure how the assignments need to 
        be done yet but I did get a start on formatting the work I 
        need to do. We will see how it goes.
