    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>This week was a good week with meeting with my team. I was a little
        worried about working with my team, but after our first meeting I 
        was impressed with all of my group member. One of them, Kevin I 
        believe, does web development for a living. He taught a couple 
        sections and he was able to go over things really well. I think
        that he will be a great resource to the class and to our group.
    </p>

        Our communication has been pretty good. We are actually using
        the chat in Zoom and it has been working out well.  
    </p>

        Seeing the work that Kevin and Jordon did really opened my eyes
        to a new way to get my site setup and how to show working examples.
        I am looking forward to working more with them. I just hope that
        I can keep up.
