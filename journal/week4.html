    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p>
        This week I think the most helpful thing was the meeting with 
        Brother Thayne. It is helpful when he goes through examples of 
        code and to be able to get an idea of what is expected for the 
        class.

        I learned about a couple of new loops in JavaScript this week, 
        the for - in and for-of loops. I was able to use both of these 
        in my example code. I thought it was cool to see and learn a 
        different way to iterate through objects like arrays and 
        strings. I am still trying to come up with a use case for 
        iterating through a string. Maybe you could use it to count the 
        amount of letters in a document or other object. 
    </p>

        All of the members of my team met again this week. They are a 
        good group of students who I have already been able to learn 
        from. They are really good at helping and teaching each other. 
        I need to be more prepared to go over my code with them.
