    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <P>
        This week I was actually not able to do much work for the class because 
        I was able to go on a trip to our family property with my uncle and cousin. 
        It was a nice and needed break from work and school for me which did help 
        me to clear my head to help understand the topics that I am learning for 
        this class. 
    </P>
