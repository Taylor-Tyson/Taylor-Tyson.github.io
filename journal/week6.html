    <h2>Week 6</h2>
    <p>
        This week I fell behind a little. I did work on doing some research 
        and I think the highlight of this week was being able to meet with 
        my group. This week was the first week I was able to "teach" and 
        show my code. I did three topics in a row which have already been
        covered but my team was very supportive and helpful. 
    </p>

        I was also impressed with the work that some of the team members do. 
        They have spent a lot of time on their assignments and have done a 
        great job.
