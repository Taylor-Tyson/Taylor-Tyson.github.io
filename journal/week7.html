    <h2>Week 7</h2>
    <p>
       This week I had a good meeting with my group. I did not go over any of the topics
       that I had with them but I did have some time to start to get more familiar with 
       some of the topics that I have left to complete. I have been feeling a little 
       overwhelmed between this class and another one that I am taking. There has been 
       many times where I have needed to pray for help to be able to get through all that 
       is going on right now, and this week was one of those weeks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am finding that I wish I had more time to work on some of these topics to better 
        learn and understand them. It is a lot of fun to do things with JavaScript and I
        am finding more and more that I really enjoy it. It has been a good week for reflection.
