    <h2>Week 8</h2>
    <p>
        This week I wasn't able to do too much because I was on call. 
        I did work on the local storage and the canvas tag. I am really
        struggling with getting the canvas tag to work for some reason. 
        I need to spend more time on it. 
    </p>

        When I was working on the local storage topic I was able to get 
        the importing of my Truck object to work. I couldn't get it to 
        work before but I was able to see things trying to use it as my 
        object to store that I didn't see before so I was able to get 
        it working. It was a good feeling because I thought it shouldn't 
        have been too difficult to get working and it really wasn't, 
        except for when it was! 
    </p>

        I did find help in the video from Brother Thayne. Those are always 
        helpful to know what is expected.
