    <h2>Week 9</h2>
    <p>
        This week I was able to spend some time getting more topics 
        completed. I was also able to meet with my group and pass teach 
        them three or four topics. One of the things that I enjoyed with 
        the class this week was working on local and session storage. I 
        always knew that sites could store data on your computer/browser 
        but I wasn't sure how. I was able to work through adding, removing, 
        and requesting data in both the local storage and session storage. 
        Session storage stays in the browser until the session is closed 
        and the local storage stays until the site removes it or you clean 
        it out manually.  It was a good week.
