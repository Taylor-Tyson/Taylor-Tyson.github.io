    <h3>CSS Transitions, Animations, and Transformations</h3>
    <p>On this page we are going to talk about and show examples of using CSS to 
        transition, animate, and transform property values of an HTML element. 
    </p>

<h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
<p>CSS transitions allow you to change the property values of an element smoothly
    and in a given duration of time. In the example below you can hover over the
    image and see the transition to a new imgage. The tranistion time is set to 
    four seconds which is kind of long but I wanted to show the transition longer.  
</p>
<div id="transition"></div>

<h2>Animations</h2>
<p>In short, CSS animations allow you to animate elements in HTML without using 
    Flash or JavaScript. That is good because some browsers are not going to support
    Flash much longer. The thing to make note of when using animations is the keyframes
    rule. You have to bind an animation to a keyframe which will run the animation 
    gradually from the current style to what you want it to be.
</p>
<p>In the following example we are going to use an animation to </p>

<p id="myAnimation" class="demo">
    This is my text that is sliding back and forth being animated. Cool eh!
</p>

<h2>Transformations</h2>
<p>Using Transformations allows you to rotate, scale, move, or skew HTML 
    elements. Hover on each of the smiley faces below to see examples of
    transformations.

<p id="demo" class="demo"></p><br><br>

<img id="image" onmouseover="rotateMsg()" onmouseout="clearMsg()" src="/media/smiley_150.jpg" alt="Smiley Face" class="rotate180">
<img id="image" onmouseover="skewMsg()" onmouseout="clearMsg()" src="/media/smiley_150.jpg" alt="Smiley Face" class="skew"><br>
<img id="image" onmouseover="scaleMsg()" onmouseout="clearMsg()" src="/media/smiley_150.jpg" alt="Smiley Face" class="scale">
<img id="image" onmouseover="spinMsg()" onmouseout="clearMsg()" src="/media/smiley_150.jpg" alt="Smiley Face" class="spin">
