    <h2>JavaScript Events</h2>
    <p>Simply put as stated on 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp">w3schools.com</a>, 
        events are just things that happen to HTML elements. You can use JavaScript
        to create and define what happens when events happen. There are a lot of 
        HTML events that you can work with. Some of the more common ones are:  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onchange</li>
        <li>Onclick</li>
        <li>Onmouseover</li>
        <li>Touch Event</li>
    </ul>
    <P>For a more defined list, visit: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp">here</a>.
        I will be doing examples of just a few of the ones listed above.         
    </P>
    <h3>Onchange</h3>
    <p>You can use the onchange event to call a function when a value of an element 
        changes. For our example we are going to make a selection which will notify 
        us what was selected. 
    </p>
    <select id="mySelection" onchange="selection()">
            <option value=""></option>
        <option value="Select Me">Select Me</option>
        <option value="No Select Me">No Select Me</option>
        <option value="You Better Select Me">You Better Select Me</option>
    </select>
    <p id="demo" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Onclick</h3>
    <p>This one I have used a lot on these pages. I have used the onclick to many times
        to call a function in JavaScript when a button is pressed. In this simple example
        we are going to click the "Click Me" button which will call a function that will 
        alert us that we clicked the button.  
    </p>
    <button onclick="clickMe()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="demo2" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Onmouseover</h3>
    <p>The onmouseover event allows you to do something when the mouse moves over an
        element. In this example there is a riddle. To find the answer to the riddle
        you can mouse over the answer box. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Can you name three consecutive days without using the words Monday, Tuesday, 
        Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="answer" onmouseover="answer()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">Answer</h3>
    <p id="demo3" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Touch Event</h3>
    <p>The touch event is good for touch devices, such as a mobile phone, tablet,
        or a computer using touch screen. The touch event will allow you to do 
        something when an element is touched. For this example we are going to 
        use another riddle and you can touch the answer to display it. 
    </p>
    <p><i>The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?</i>
        </p>
    <p id="demo4" class="demo"></p>
    <h3 id="answer" ontouchstart="touchAnswer()" ontouchend="touchEnd()">Answer</h3>
