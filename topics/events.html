    <h2>JavaScript Events</h2>
    <p>Simply put as stated on 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp">w3schools.com</a>, 
        events are just things that happen to HTML elements. You can use JavaScript
        to create and define what happens when events happen. There are a lot of 
        HTML events that you can work with. Some of the more common ones are:  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onchange</li>
        <li>Onclick</li>
        <li>Onmouseover</li>
        <li>TouchEvent</li>
    </ul>
    <P>For a more defined list, visit: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp">here</a>.
        I will be doing examples of just a few of the ones listed above.         
    </P>
    <h3>Onchange</h3>
    <p>You can use the onchange event to call a function when a value of an element 
        changes. For our example we are going to make a selection which will notify 
        us what was selected. 
    </p>
    <select id="mySelection" onchange="selection()">
            <option value=""></option>
        <option value="Select Me">Select Me</option>
        <option value="No Select Me">No Select Me</option>
        <option value="You Better Select Me">You Better Select Me</option>
    </select>
    <p id="demo" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Onclick</h3>
    <p>This one I have used a lot on these pages. I have used the onclick to many times
        to call a function in JavaScript when a button is pressed. In this simple example
        we are going to click the "Click Me" button which will call a function that will 
        alert us that we clicked the button.  
    </p>
    <button onclick="clickMe()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="demo2" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Onmouseover</h3>
    <p>The onmouseover event allows you to do something when the mouse moves over an
        element. In this example there is a riddle. To find the answer to the riddle
        you can mouse over the answer box. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Can you name three consecutive days without using the words Monday, Tuesday, 
        Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="answer" onmouseover="answer()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">Answer</h3>
    <p id="demo3" class="demo"></p>
