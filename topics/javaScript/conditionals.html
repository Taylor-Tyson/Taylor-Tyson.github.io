    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements are very usefule and used quite often. You use 
        conditional statements when you need to perform an action based on a
        logical condition. Some of the statements that can be used are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li<>IF Statement</li>
        <li<>Else Statement</li>
        <li<>Else If Statement</li>
        <li<>Switch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to talk about just a few of them.</p>

    <h3>IF Statement</h3>
    <p>The if statement is used to run a block of code if a condition is true. We are going to 
        give an example of the IF statement by testing if 2 is equal to 2. If it it then it will 
        tell us. 
    </p>
    <button onclick="ifStatement()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="demo" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Else Statement</h3>
    <p>The if statement is used to run a block of code if a condition is false. In this example
        we are going to check and see if 2 is equal to 3. If it is not, then it will tell us: 
    </p>
    <button onclick="elseStatement()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="demo1" class="demo"></p>


    <h3>ELSE IF Statement</h3>
    <p>The if statement is used to run a block of code the first condition is true in a 
        seperate test. So in this example we will check if 2 is equal to 3 and if not we
        will check if it is equal to 3. 
    </p>
    <button onclick="elseIfStatement()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="demo2" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Switch</h3>
    <p>The switch allows you to make choices and what to do for each choice. To see an example of a 
        case switch go to <a href="/topics/javascript-objects.html">JavaScript Objects</a> page.
        A switch is being used for the 
        JavaScript example.
