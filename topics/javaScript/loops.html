    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>Thare are five different kinds of loops that you can use in JavaScript.
        Loops are used to execute the same block of code more than once. They 
        are good for automoting repetitive tasks in your program. The loops that
        we are going to talk about are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>while loop</li>
        <li>do-while loop</li>
        <li>for loop</li>
        <li>for-in  loop</li>
        <li>for-of loop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One importnat thing to mention with using loops is that you need to be carefule
        that you don't code them in a way that creates an infinite loop. This will cause
        your program and computer major issues! 
    </p>
    <h3>While Loop</h3>
    <p>The while loop is a loop that will exeucte while a variable is set at a 
        certain value. In our example we are going to click the count down button 
        and count down from five using a while loop. 
    </p>
    <button type=button onclick="countDown()">Count Down</button>
    <p id="cntDown" class="demo"></p>
    <p>When you click the button it is calling a function that contains the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        function countDown(){
            let i = 5;
            let myText = "";
            
            while (i >= 0){
                myText += < br> + i;
                i--;
            }
            document.getElementById("cntDown").innerHTML
             = myText;
        }</code>
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Do-while Loop</h3>
    <p>The do-while loop is similar to using the while loop. The main difference I could find
        between the two is that when using the while loop, the code in the loop will only be
        executed if the condition is in a true state. If it is not, then the code will not be
        executed. With a do-while loop, it will always run the code in the loop once and stop 
        when the condition is in a false state. 
    </p>
    <p>In this example when you click the count up button it will count up from zero to five.   </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="countUp()">Count Up</button>
    <p id="cntUp" class="demo"></p>
    <p>When you click the button it is calling a function that contains the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        function countUp() {
            let i = 0;
            let myText = "";
                
            do {
                myText += "< br>" + i;
                i++;
            }
            while (i <= 5);
            document.getElementById("cntUp").innerHTML
            = myText;
        }</code>
    </pre>


    <h3>For Loop</h3>
    <p>When using the for loop, we are also going to demonstrate how to use an array. 
        For loops are good for iterating through an object, such as an array. In this example 
        we are going to click on a button that will list out the contents of car manufacturers
        in a pre-defined array. 
    </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="listArray()">List Arrray</button>
    <p id="listArray" class="demo"></p>
    <p>When you click the button it is calling a function that contains the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        function listArray() {
            let myText = "";
                               
            for (let i = 0; i < manufactuers.length; i++) {
                myText += manufactuers[i] + ", ";
            }
            document.getElementById("listArray").innerHTML
            = myText;
        }</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>For-in Loop</h3>
    <p>The for-in loop is a cool loop to use to iterate through object. It is similar
        to the for loop, but the syntax is a little easier and cleaner to use. It uses 
        a string instead of a number for the counter. 
    </p>
    <p>Ini this example we are going to use the same array we used in the for loop demo. 
        When you click the For-In Loop button it will display the contents of the 
        manufactuers array just like the for loop. 
    </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="forIn()">For-In Loop</button>
    <p id="forin" class="demo"></p>
    <p>When you click the button it is calling a function that contains the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        function forIn() {
            let myText = "";
                
        for(let i in manufactuers)
            myText += manufactuers[i] + ", "
                
        document.getElementById("forin").innerHTML
        = myText;
        }</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>For-of Loop</h3>
    <p>The for-of loop is yet another way to iterate through objects such as arrays. One 
        thing about the for-of loop is that it can also allow you to iterate through other
        iterable objects such as a string. This is something new to me and sounds cool. 
    </p>
    <p>For this example we are going to iterate through a string. Type in a string in and click 
        on the Iterate button.
    </p>
    <input type="text" id="myText"><br>
    <button type=button onclick="forOf()" value="">For-Of Loop</button>
    <p id="iterate" class="demo" value=""></p>
    <p>When you click the button it is calling a function that contains the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        function forOf() {
            let userInput = 
            document.getElementById("myText").value;
            let myText = "";
                
            for(let char of userInput) {
                myText += char + " - ";
            }
            document.getElementById("iterate").innerHTML
            = myText;
        }</code>
    </pre>
