    <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript are an important part of using JavaScript. To me it 
        seems that objects in JavaScript are somewhat confusing at first, but when you 
        start to understnad them they are easy to work with. In realiity, almost 
        everything in JavaScript are objects. Here is a list of some common objects: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boolens (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Numbers (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Strings (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Dates</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One thing that you can also do is create your own object. In the next couple examples
        I am going to show how you can do that in different ways. 
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript Object Literal</h3>
    <p>An oject literal is created with a comma seperated list of name-value 
        pairs. This would look something like:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        let truck = {
            manufacturer: "Ford",
            model: "F-350",
            year: 2020
        };</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Now that we have our object, we can get the properties of it all together 
        or individually. Choose an option below: 
    </p>
    <select id="selection" onchange="getLiteral()">
        <option value="blank"></option>
        <option value="manufacturer">Manufacturer</option>
        <option value="model">Model</option>
        <option value="year">Year</option>
    </select><br><br>
    <!-- <button type=button onclick="getLiteral()" value="">Submit</button> -->
    <p id="literal" class="demo" value=""></p>

    <h2>JavaScript Class</h2>
    <p>Classes in JavaScript are a type of function that are declared with the 
        keyword class. The properties of the class are assigned inside of a 
        constructor method. In this example we are going to be using a Truck 
        class which was created as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        export class Truck {
            constructor(manufacturer, model, year){
                this.manufacturer = manufactuer;
                this.model = model;
                this.year = year;
            }
        }</code>
    </pre>

    <p>To use this class we will need to create a Truck. Please fill out and 
        the Truck submit the information for the Truck you would like to create:
    </p>
    <input type="text" id="manu"> Manufacturer<br>
    <input type="text" id="model"> Model<br>
    <input type="text" id="year"> Year<br><br>
    <button type=button onclick="createTruck()">Create Truck</button>
    <p id="newTruck" class="demo"></p>
