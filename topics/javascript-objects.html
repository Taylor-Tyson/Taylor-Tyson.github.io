    <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript are an important part of using JavaScript. To me it 
        seems that objects in JavaScript are somewhat confusing at first, but when you 
        start to understnad them they are easy to work with. In realiity, almost 
        everything in JavaScript are objects. Here is a list of some common objects: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boolens (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Numbers (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Strings (If defined correctly)</li>
        <li>Dates</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One thing that you can also do is create your own object. In the next few examples
        I am going to show how you can do that in different ways. 
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript Object Literal</h3>
    <p>An oject literal is created with a comma seperated list of name-value 
        pairs. This would look something like:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        let truck = {
            manufacturer: "Ford",
            Model: "F-350",
            Year: 2020
        };</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Now that we have our object, we can get the properties of it all together 
        or individually. Choose an option below: 
    </p>
    <select id="selection" onchange="getLiteral()">
        <option value="blank"></option>
        <option value="manufacturer">Manufacturer</option>
        <option value="model">Model</option>
        <option value="year">Year</option>
    </select><br><br>
    <!-- <button type=button onclick="getLiteral()" value="">Submit</button> -->
    <p id="literal" class="demo" value=""></p>
