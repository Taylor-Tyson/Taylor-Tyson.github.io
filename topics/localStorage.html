    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>With local storage there are two places that you can store information. One is 
        local storage where you can store information that does not expire or delte. 
        Data is stored in the broweser and the only way to remove it is to manually do 
        it in your browser or to clear it out with your code. 

        The other type of storage is called session storage. With session storage, the 
        data is stored for the life of the session. Once the session is closed then 
        it will clear out. 
    </p>
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>To demonstrate the local storage, click the "Load Local" button below. 
        This will load call a function to load trucks into the local storage. 
        You can also clear the local storage by clicking on the "Clear" button and
        test that is was removed. 
    </p>
    <button onclick="loadLocal()">Load Local</button>
    <button onclick="clearLocal()">Clear</button>
    <p id="demo" class="demo"></p>

    <p>Now that we have trucks in the local storage we will retrieve it and display it
        by clicking the "Retrieve Local" button.
    </p>
    <button onclick="getLocal()">Retrieve Local</button>
    <p id="demo1" class="demo"></p>

    <h3>Session Storage</h3>
    <p>To demonstrate session storage enter your name in the box below and click 
        the submit button. This will store your name to the session storage. 
    </p>
    <input type="text" id="myText"><br>
    <button type=button onclick="loadSession()">Submit</button>
    <p id="demo2" class="demo"></p>

    <p>Now that we have set the name in session storage, lets retrieve it by clicking 
        the retrieve button. 
    </p>
    <button onclick="getSession()">Load Local</button>
    <p id="demo3" class="demo"></p>
