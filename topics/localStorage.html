    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>With local storage there are two places that you can store information. One is 
        local storage where you can store information that does not expire or delte. 
        Data is stored in the broweser and the only way to remove it is to manually do 
        it in your browser or to clear it out with your code. 

        The other type of storage is called session storage. With session storage, the 
        data is stored for the life of the session. Once the session is closed then 
        it will clear out.
